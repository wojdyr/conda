--------------------
  * resolve.py: properly escape periods in version numbers, #1926
  * support for pinning Lua by default, #1934
  * remove hard-coded test URLs, a module cio_test is now expected when CIO_TEST is set
  * resolve.py: "conda update <package>" now performs any necessary updates to 
    dependencies as well. Previously conda ignored the dependencies during the
    update by default, potentially resulting in an inconsistent package set. To
    revert to the old behavior, use "conda update --no-update-deps".


2015-12-17   3.19.0:
--------------------
  * OpenBSD 5.x support, #1891
  * improve install CLI to make Miniconda -f work, #1905

--------------------
  * fix bad menuinst exception handling, #1798
  * add workaround for unresolved dependencies on Windows


2015-11-09   3.18.4:
--------------------
  * allow explicit file to contain MD5 hashsums
  * add --md5 option to "conda list --explicit"
  * stop infinite recursion during certain resolve operations, #1749
  * add dependencies even if strictness == 3, #1766


2015-10-15   3.18.3:
--------------------
  * added a pruning step for more efficient solves, #1702
  * disallow conda-env to be installed into non-root environment

    to be installed, and can used with the install/create --file option, #1688
  * fix a potential issue in conda clean
  * avoid issues with LookupErrors when updating Python in the root
    environment on Windows
  * don't fetch the index from the network with conda remove
  * when installing conda packages directly, "conda install <pkg>.tar.bz2",
    unlink any installed package with that name (not just the installed one)
  * allow menu items to be installed in non-root env, #1692


2015-09-28   3.18.1:
--------------------

2015-09-28   3.18.0:
--------------------
  * allow Python to be updated in root environment on Windows, #1657
  * add defaults to specs after getting pinned specs (allows to pin a
    different version of Python than what is installed)
  * show what older versions are in the solutions in the resolve debug log
  * fix some issues with Python 3.5
  * respect --no-deps when installing from .tar or .tar.bz2
  * avoid infinite recursion with NoPackagesFound and conda update --all --file
  * fix conda update --file
  * toposort: Added special case to remove 'pip' dependency from 'python'
  * show dotlog messages during hint generation with --debug
  * disable the max_only heuristic during hint generation
  * new version comparison algorithm, which consistently compares any version
    string, and better handles version strings using things like alpha, beta,
    rc, post, and dev. This should remove any inconsistent version comparison
    that would lead to conda installing an incorrect version.
  * use the trash in rm_rf, meaning more things will get the benefit of the
    trash system on Windows
  * add the ability to pass the --file argument multiple times
  * add conda upgrade alias for conda update

    command line flags
  * allow specs with conda update --all
  * add --show-channel-urls and --no-show-channel-urls command line options
  * add always_copy condarc option
  * conda clean properly handles multiple envs directories. This breaks
    backwards compatibility with some of the --json output. Some of the old
    --json keys are kept for backwards compatibility.


2015-09-11   3.17.0:
--------------------
  * add windows_forward_slashes option to walk_prefix(), see #1513

  * don't exit nonzero when installing a package with no dependencies
  * check which features are installed in an environment via track_features,
    not features
  * set the verify flag directly on CondaSession (fixes conda skeleton not
    respecting the ssl_verify option)


2015-07-23   3.15.1:
--------------------
  * fix conda with older versions of argcomplete
  * restore the --force-pscheck option as a no-op for backwards
    compatibility


2015-07-22   3.15.0:
--------------------
  * sort the output of conda info package correctly
  * enable tab completion of conda command extensions using
    argcomplete. Command extensions that import conda should use
    conda.cli.conda_argparse.ArgumentParser instead of
    argparse.ArgumentParser. Otherwise, they should enable argcomplete
    completion manually.
  * allow psutil and pycosat to be updated in the root environment on Windows
  * remove all mentions of pscheck. The --force-pscheck flag has been removed.
  * added support for S3 channels
  * fix color issues from pip in conda list on Windows
  * add support for other machine types on Linux, in particular ppc64le

  * enable --set to work with both boolean and string values


2015-06-29   3.14.1:
--------------------
  * make use of Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_PSS module, see #1388
  * note when features are being used in the unsatisfiable hint

  * handle env dirs not existing in the Environments completer
  * rename binstar.org -> anaconda.org, see #1348
  * speed up 'source activate' by ~40%


2015-05-05   3.12.0:
--------------------
  * correctly allow conda to update itself
  * print which file leads to the "unable to remove file" error on Windows
  * add support for the no_proxy environment variable, #1171
  * add a much faster hint generation for unsatisfiable packages, which is now
    always enabled (previously it would not run if there were more than ten
    specs). The new hint only gives one set of conflicting packages, rather
    than all sets, so multiple passes may be necessary to fix such issues
  * conda extensions that import conda should use
    conda.cli.conda_argparser.ArgumentParser instead of
    argparse.ArgumentParser to conform to the conda help guidelines (e.g., all
    help messages should be capitalized with periods, and the options should
    be preceded by "Options:" for the sake of help2man).
  * add confirmation dialog to conda remove. Fixes conda remove --dry-run.


2015-04-22   3.11.0:
--------------------
  * fix issue where forced update on Windows could cause a package to break
  * remove detection of running processes that might conflict

  * handle CIO_TEST='2 '
  * always find the solution with minimal number of packages, even if there
    are many solutions
  * allow comments at the end of the line in requirement files
  * don't update the progressbar until after the item is finished running
  * add conda/<version> to HTTP header User-Agent string


2015-03-12   3.10.0:

  * prevent the progressbar from crashing conda when fetching in some
    situations


2014-11-05   3.7.3:
-------------------
  * conda install from a local conda package (or a tar fill which
    contains conda packages), will now also install the dependencies
    listed by the installed packages.
  * add SOURCE_DIR environment variable in pre-link subprocess
  * record all created environments in ~/.conda/environments.txt


2014-10-31   3.7.2:
-------------------
  * only show the binstar install message once
  * print the fetching repodata dot after the repodata is fetched
  * write the install and remove specs to the history file
  * add '-y' as an alias to '--yes'

  * cache the proxy username and password
  * avoid warning about conda in pscheck
  * make ~/.conda/envs the first user envs dir


2014-10-07   3.7.1:
-------------------
  * improve error message for forgetting to use source with activate and
    deactivate, see issue #601
  * don't allow to remove the current environment, see issue #639

2014-09-19   3.7.0:
-------------------
  * faster algorithm for --alt-hint
  * don't allow channel_alias with allow_other_channels: false if it is set in
    the system .condarc

  * be more careful in conda config about keys that are the wrong type
  * don't expect directories starting with conda- to be commands
  * no longer recommend to run conda init after pip installing conda. A pip
    installed conda will now work without being initialized to create and
    manage other environments
  * the rm function on Windows now works around access denied errors
  * fix channel urls now showing with conda list with show_channel_urls set to
    true


2014-09-08   3.6.4:
-------------------
  * fix removing packages that aren't in the channels any more

-------------------
  * skip packages that can't be found with update --all

    Windows
  * retain Unix style path separators for prefixes in has_prefix on
    Windows (if the placeholder path uses /, replace it with a path that uses
    /, not \)
  * fix bug in --use-local due to API changes in conda-build
  * include user site directories in conda info -s
  * make binary has_prefix replacement work with spaces after the prefix
  * make binary has_prefix replacement replace multiple occurrences of the
    placeholder in the same null-terminated string
  * don't show packages from other platforms as installed or cached in conda
    search
  * be more careful about not warning about conda itself in pscheck
  * Use a progress bar for the unsatisfiable packages hint generation
  * Don't use TemporaryFile in try_write, as it is too slow when it fails
  * Ignore InsecureRequestWarning when ssl_verify is False
  * conda remove removes features tracked by removed packages in
    track_features

-------------------
  * add --use-index-cache to conda remove
  * fix a bug where features (like mkl) would be selected incorrectly
  * use concurrent.future.ThreadPool to fetch package metadata asynchronously
    in Python 3.
  * do the retries in rm_rf on every platform
  * use a higher cutoff for package name misspellings

  * correctly check if a package can be hard-linked if it isn't extracted yet
  * change how the package plan is printed to better show what is new,
    updated, and downgraded
  * use suggest_normalized_version in the resolve module. Now versions like
    1.0alpha that are not directly recognized by verlib's NormalizedVersion
    are supported better
  * conda run command, to run apps and commands from packages
  * more complete --json API. Every conda command should fully support --json
    output now.

  * update optional psutil dependency was updated to psutil 2.0 or higher


2014-05-15   3.5.0:

  * fixed empty history file causing crash, issue #644
  * remove timezone information from history file, fixes issue #651

  * add --alt-hint as a method to get an alternate form of a hint for
    unsatisfiable packages
  * add conda package --ls-files to list files in a package
  * add ability to pin specs in an environment. To pin a spec, add a file
    called pinned to the environment's conda-meta directory with the specs to
    pin. Pinned specs are always kept installed, unless the --no-pin flag is
    used.
  * fix keyboard interrupting of external commands. Now keyboard interupting
    conda build correctly removes the lock file
  * add no_link ability to conda, see issue #678


2014-04-07   3.4.1:
-------------------
  * always use a pkgs cache directory associated with an envs directory, even
    when using -p option with an arbitrary a prefix which is not inside an
    envs dir
  * add setting of PYTHONHOME to conda info --system
  * skip packages with bad metadata


2014-04-02   3.4.0:
-------------------
  * added revision history to each environment:
      - conda list --revisions
      - conda install --revision
      - log is stored in conda-meta/history
  * allow parsing pip-style requirement files with --file option and in command
    line arguments, e.g. conda install 'numpy>=1.7', issue #624
  * fix error message for --file option when file does not exist
  * allow DEFAULTS in CONDA_ENVS_PATH, which expands to the defaults settings,
    including the condarc file
  * don't install a package with a feature (like mkl) unless it is
    specifically requested (i.e., that feature is already enabled in that
    environment)
  * add ability to show channel URLs when displaying what is going to be
    downloaded by setting "show_channel_urls: True" in condarc
  * fix the --quiet option
  * skip packages that have dependencies that can't be found


2014-03-24   3.3.2:
-------------------
  * fix the --file option
  * check install arguments before fetching metadata
  * fix a printing glitch with the progress bars
  * give a better error message for conda clean with no arguments
  * don't include unknown packages when searching another platform


2014-03-19   3.3.1:
-------------------
  * Fix setting of PS1 in activate.
  * Add conda update --all.
  * Allow setting CONDARC=' ' to use no condarc.
  * Add conda clean --packages.
  * Don't include bin/conda, bin/activate, or bin/deactivate in conda
    package.


2014-03-18   3.3.0:
-------------------
  * allow new package specification, i.e. ==, >=, >, <=, <, != separated
    by ',' for example: >=2.3,<3.0
  * add ability to disable self update of conda, by setting
    "self_update: False" in .condarc
  * Try installing packages using the old way of just installing the maximum
    versions of things first. This provides a major speedup of solving the
    package specifications in the cases where this scheme works.
  * Don't include python=3.3 in the specs automatically for the Python 3
    version of conda.  This allows you to do "conda create -n env package" for
    a package that only has a Python 2 version without specifying
    "python=2". This change has no effect in Python 2.
  * Automatically put symlinks to conda, activate, and deactivate in each
    environment on Unix.
  * On Unix, activate and deactivate now remove the root environment from the
    PATH. This should prevent "bleed through" issues with commands not
    installed in the activated environment but that are installed in the root
    environment. If you have "setup.py develop" installed conda on Unix, you
    should run this command again, as the activate and deactivate scripts have
    changed.
  * Begin work to support Python 3.4.
  * Fix a bug in version comparison
  * Fix usage of sys.stdout and sys.stderr in environments like pythonw on
    Windows where they are nonstandard file descriptors.


2014-03-12   3.2.1:
-------------------
  * fix installing packages with irrational versions
  * fix installation in the api
  * use a logging handler to print the dots


2014-03-11   3.2.0:
-------------------
  * print dots to the screen for progress
  * move logic functions from resolve to logic module


2014-03-07   3.2.0a1:
---------------------
  * conda now uses pseudo-boolean constraints in the SAT solver. This allows
    it to search for all versions at once, rather than only the latest (issue
    #491).
  * Conda contains a brand new logic submodule for converting pseudo-boolean
    constraints into SAT clauses.


2014-03-07   3.1.1:
-------------------
  * check if directory exists, fixed issue #591


2014-03-07   3.1.0:
-------------------
  * local packages in cache are now added to the index, this may be disabled
    by using the --known option, which only makes conda use index metadata
    from the known remote channels
  * add --use-index-cache option to enable using cache of channel index files
  * fix ownership of files when installing as root on Linux
  * conda search: add '.' symbol for extracted (cached) packages


2014-02-20   3.0.6:
-------------------
  * fix 'conda update' taking build number into account


2014-02-17   3.0.5:
-------------------
  * allow packages from create_default_packages to be overridden from the
    command line
  * fixed typo install.py, issue #566
  * try to prevent accidentally installing into a non-root conda environment


2014-02-14   3.0.4:
-------------------
  * conda update: don't try to update packages that are already up-to-date


2014-02-06   3.0.3:
-------------------
  * improve the speed of clean --lock
  * some fixes to conda config
  * more tests added
  * choose the first solution rather than the last when there are more than
    one, since this is more likely to be the one you want.


2014-02-03   3.0.2:
